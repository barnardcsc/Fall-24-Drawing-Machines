Learn how to design generative art using code!  In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of creating computational art using Processing, including drawing basic shapes, creating patterns, and introducing randomness to add character to your designs.  We'll then use the AxiDraw computer-controlled machine to create physical postcards of the art you create. Through this process, participants will be able to take home a piece of art that they created and learn about the history of computer code and digital art.
